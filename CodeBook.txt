Consists of input data information and process used for extracting and compiling data into two csv files 

Study Design

The source data was collected from the Coursera project link to complete the project. The process involved reading and merging the data set to produce two readable csv files consisting data frames of merged test and train readings and an output csv file with average of merged data per subject per actiity.
The process involved 
Downloade data from link
Unzipped the data 
Convert the directory of unzipped folder to working directory
Read test and train data files into data frames
Read variable names and assign them to test and train data sets
Read activity labels 
Rbind test and train data sets
Paired down the data frames to only include the mean and standard deviation variables
Replaced activityID with lables 
Merge the data sets 
Write "cleandata.csv" with the combined data frame 
Created another data set using the data.table library to easily group the tidy data by subject and activity
Then applied the mean and standard deviation calculations across the groups
Write "Average.csv" as the condensed average output per subject per activity
Variables
subjectId: 1 to 30 
activity: the activity used for measurement
